TECHNOLOGIES AND FEATURES

The application leverages a robust technology stack combining Flask as the core web framework with SQLAlchemy for database operations and user management. The frontend utilizes modern HTML5, CSS3 with custom properties and animations, and vanilla JavaScript with EventSource API for real-time progress updates and interactive dashboards. Cloud integration is achieved through official SDKs including AWS Boto3 for Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud SDK for GCP operations, and Azure SDK for Microsoft Azure services. The security scanning engine implements parallel processing capabilities to efficiently assess cloud resources across multiple providers simultaneously. Key features include automated vulnerability detection for misconfigured storage buckets, overly permissive IAM roles, exposed databases, and insecure network configurations. The application provides comprehensive compliance reporting with customizable templates, scheduled scanning capabilities with cron-like functionality, real-time notification systems with animated UI feedback, and detailed analytics dashboards featuring progress bars, status indicators, and interactive charts. The Enterprise Command Center offers centralized security orchestration with role-based access controls, while the responsive design ensures optimal user experience across desktop and mobile devices.
