### 3. Git Commands for v0.1

Run these commands one by one in your terminal from your project folder. This will create your first commit, tag it as `v0.1`, and push it to GitHub.

1. **Initialize the repository** (only run this once for the very first commit):
   
   ```bash
   git init -b main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/SubashUduwaka/cloud-security-scanner.git
   ```
2. **Add and commit the files:**
   
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Add v0.1 S3 scanner script"
   ```
3. **Create the version tag:**
   
   ```bash
   git tag -a v0.1 -m "Version 0.1: Initial S3 Scanner"
   ```
4. **Push the commit and the tag to GitHub:**
   
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   git push origin v0.1
   ```
